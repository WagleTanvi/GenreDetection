An Exploration into the problem of Genre Detection

## Background 

As a part of Principles of Artificial Intelligence, I chose to explore the problem of Genre Detection for my semester project. 

## Files 
* **Music Genre Detection.pptx** = This is my final presentation and describes my objectives, process, results etc. 
* **GTZAN-data/** = This folder contains all the notebooks that explored the GTZAN dataset and generated the results. Because of the large nature of the data, it is not included in this folder. 
* **spotify-data/** = This folder contains all the notebooks that explored the Spotify API music files. The notebook used for the results and analysis is *Spotify Audio Feature Training.ipynb*. In order to run this, you need to create an appliation in the spotify developer dashboard and insert your client id and secret.
